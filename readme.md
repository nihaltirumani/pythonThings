# 🐍 pythonThings

Welcome to **pythonThings**, a personal collection of Python projects created during my learning journey. This repository includes a mix of beginner-friendly scripts, small projects, and experiments using popular Python libraries like `pygame` and `tkinter`. All files are written in plain `.py` format for easy readability and execution.

## 📂 About This Repository

This repo serves as a growing archive of things I've built while exploring Python programming. It includes:

- ✅ **Mini Projects** – Simple programs and logic-based implementations.
- 🎮 **Pygame Experiments** – Interactive games and visual effects using the `pygame` library.
- 🖼️ **Basic GUI Apps** – A few graphical user interface projects using `tkinter` (lightly included).
- 🧪 **Testing Projects** - Temporary projects which I experiment.

Most projects are built with the goal of reinforcing concepts, practicing syntax, and having fun with code!
